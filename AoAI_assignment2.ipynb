      "\u001b[0m This entry level version of the iconic pony car looks muscular  from the flared wheel arches to the bumped up hood to the angled real lights and the agressive  mean   front headlights  Overall  though not classy or subtle  I find the shape attractive Loading up luggage is not a piece of cake  the boot is deep and wide  but the narrow opening makes it rather difficult to insert big items  A large size suitcase can barely be inserted  and as a result blocks access to the remainder of the trunk space  While on the topic  the glovebox is very small too  The instrument panel is clearly laid out  looks the business  Standard radio CD works decently  but the old fashioned telescopic antenna sticking out of the front right wing is anachronic  The headlights switch is a surprising design detail  I dont know if it echoes a feature of the original Mustangs  but its looks and its feel are really out of place  pulling on this button and hearing a whine when you rotate it to adjust the instrument backlight is the kind of heritage that contemporary buyers will easily want to do   without The front seats are not uncomfortable  but lateral support came really short of my expectations  Exploring the grip limits is a spine bending experience and makes you feel really uncomfortable  The fabric they are made off is cheap synthetic stuff  and the fit between parts forming the dash and central console does not leave a lasting impression of quality  wide gaps  mistalignment  leagues behind german  japanese  or maybe even korean standards The steering wheel  while a tad too big in diameter  offers good grip  an adequate thumbs in position  and is thick enough  The steering column feel remains quite numb however  the steering is not overly assisted  but does not communicate much about whats happening under the front wheels If I were to single out the one thing I disliked most about the car  it would certainly be the 4 speed  or rather 3  overdrive as I later discovered  auto transmission  Start from the fact that the gear change is located ridiculously far forward on the central console to be naturally within reach  The 4th  overdrive  gear is  as frequently  ridiculously long  making it really usable for highway cruising but a real annoyance in mid speed winding roads  As the overdrive engages as soon as you lift the throttle  it makes uphill or downhill driving a frustrating experience  2nd feels too short  The only remedy is to play with the overdrive off button concealed on the side of the lever  took me a while to discover it  Another gripe  the car I had was new  3000 miles  but the transmission sounded like a 300 000 miles yellow cab  with a vacuum cleaner noise in 1st and 2nd gear  torque converter   which sounded out of place at best  worrying at worst  Upshifts were not too smooth  contemporary gearboxes can achieve much better results  and downshifts felt busy and clumsy  not the seamless power on demand response you can obtain from german or japanese 5 speed automatic gearboxes The engine itself is decently torquey  max torque is reached at 2750 rpm according to the spec sheet and the car feels that way  but  for the sake of comparison  a GM V6 like the Pontiac GrandAms is far more convincing  both in terms of grunt and noise  Redline is low  5300 rpm  and there is little incentive to rev it up that high  the engine does not sound rev happy at all  The car  equipped with standard 16 inch wheels  felt decently planted on its wheels  with grippy 225 tires  Turn in remained a bit lazy but the body roll is kept well in control   The Mustang goes where it is requested to  but there would be about as much feel as with a Playstation game  Visually  17 inchers would not look or feel out of place at all  The rear displays a hint of mobility  read tendancy to oversteer  although it is quickly tamed by the  switchable  anti skid control  The absence of a blocking rear differential may cause occasional inner rear wheel spin  especially on the wet  If you are seeking to be the king of power slides in the neighborhood  a V8 GT may be a better solution  The live rear axle is clearly perceivable through occasional sideways wobbles on uneven roads  not overly disturbing at a restrained pace  but likely to upset the cars balance at the limit  I would say that the chassis is good enough to cope with the 190hp of the base V6 without too much drama  but without too much competence and margin either  \n",

      "\u001b[0m We bought this van in 1999  after having been a rental since its  birth  Initially we loved it  It was everything we had dreamed about and more  There was plenty of room for 7 and rode extremely nice  even in the very back  We had heard nothing but good about this van  its safety ratings  ease of driving  etc  It was the GL model  and had rear heat air and stereo controls  The front seats were bucket  while the two in back were bench  Everything about it was wonderful UNTIL We had around 70 000 miles on it and the transmission went out of it  Things seemed to roll downhill from there  We replaced the tranny and a few weeks later the interior of the sliding door fell off  It had constant problems with the ignition switch and was always dinging whether or not the keys were in it  the lights were on  whatever  The interior lights stayed on all the time as well  The door ajar light was always on  no matter what was done to ensure that all the doors were closed  No lie  a few times this van even started itself when the keys werent even in it  The gas mileage was only about 17 18 mpg  The air conditioning would literally run you out it got so cold  We never did have any problems with the air or heat  It rode very nice  and drove very nice  but all in all  Id say it definately wasnt worth the money paid  and was more of a headache than it was worth  \n",

      "\u001b[0m Two years ago  I had been dreaming about owning one of those monsters I had been seeing on the roads  The Ford Expedition  I love big Trucks and this one had just come out the year before  It looked classy  sporty and aggressive at the same time  So I went SUV shopping  I drove the Durango  the Isuzu  and many others  Many but the Tahoe  I cannot tell you why  Maybe it was just the shape of it  it looked old  They had remaind he same for years  a big rectangular box on wheels Well  I ended up leasing a brand new 98 Eddie Bauer Ford Expedition  I live in the South East where it never snows and I dont have time to go off road  so I decided to save money but getting the 2WD  This truck just has everyhting on it  Awesome 7 speaker stereo  power everything  6CD changer  turning signal integrated in the mirrors for aded safety  lit running board  third row seat  automatic lights  leater seats  power driver seat  etc  It is very very roomy expct for people seating in the third row seat  but lets not be too demanding  It   seemed   luxurious and safe and so big  i loved it  we had taken the 5 4 liter V8 whihc I Highly recommend considering the size and weight of this truck  The standard 4 6L has a hard time moving this truck in and out of traffic The 5 4L is powerful and is enough  However  it is noisy  When you pus the pedal down the cabin fills with noise and it is quite disppointing for 36k luxuary car  After driving this truck for a year  and driving other cars and SUVS  I quikcly became more and more disappointed  What I thought was luxury  was just a facade  Plastic elements are of poor quality and are poorly assembled  There are too many large gaps betwee dashboard elements and doors  etc  Second disappointment  after the excitment of buying the Expedition was gone  was the lack of torque and power  Drive an expdition  then a Tahoe  and you ll understand what i am talking about  The Chevy powerplant is a lot more powerful and efficient  it ll let you spin the wheels at a red light  The expedition is more like an   Escargot   Third and major disappointment is the ride mainly over bumps  holes  and the handling in curves  You might not realize it as a driver  but seat on the right side a few times and it ll become obvious  I was wondering why my wife kept comlaining about my driving  The truck bounces you all over the places when turing  braking a little hard  or drivig on older bumpy roads  It also tends to lie on its side when turning  A 36 0000 dollar luxury SUV should not bounce you so bad and force you to hold on tight ot the door handle and the dash board  unless you wnat a work out i do not feel as safe driving it now I have since driven a TAHOE and ridden in a SUBURBAN  the engine is a lot more powerful and adequate for such a car  and the ride is a lot more comfortable Finally  I will end saying that in a year I had to take my Brand New 36k Expediiton to the shop twice  thre parts broke in the sunroof  10 days without a car and the Auto Air Valve broke Make sure you ride the Chevy trucks before giving up to the good looks of the Expedition  and to the image of driving one Good car hunting     \n",
